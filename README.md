- 👋 Hi, I’m @BoozedDuck
- 👀 I’m interested in javascript frameworks... even though I don't know any javascript. T-SQL is fun, but SQL Server licenses are hella expensive.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust. Still don't know what to do with it, hoping inspiration strikes at some point.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... something, at some point. I'm new to this.
- 📫 How to reach me? I don't know, does Github have a messaging service?
